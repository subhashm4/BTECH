Mechanical engineering is the application of the principles and problem-solving techniques of engineering from design to manufacturing to the marketplace for any object.
Mechanical engineers analyze their work using the principles of motion, energy, and forceâ€”ensuring that designs function safely, efficiently, and reliably, all at a competitive cost.
Mechanical engineers make a difference. That's because mechanical engineering careers center on creating technologies to meet human needs.
Virtually every product or service in modern life has probably been touched in some way by a mechanical engineer to help humankind.
This includes solving today's problems and creating future solutions in health care, energy, transportation, world hunger, space exploration, climate change, and more.
